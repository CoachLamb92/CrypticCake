Fine-Tune or Customize an Existing LLM
Much more practical for most use cases:

1. Pick a Base Model
Open-source models:

LLaMA 2
Mistral
Mixtral
GPT-NeoX
Use through Hugging Face, Ollama, or Transformers library

2. Choose a Customization Type
Instruction-tuning: Teach it to follow human instructions better
Domain fine-tuning: Improve it on legal, medical, or crossword clues
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Add external knowledge without retraining
LoRA/QLoRA: Efficient low-rank fine-tuning

3. Prepare Your Data
Format: JSONL or other plain text with prompt-response pairs
{"prompt": "Solve this clue: Lift former partner for praise (6)", "response": "Answer: EXTOL"}

4. Fine-Tune with Tools
Hugging Face transformers + accelerate

Libraries like:
PEFT for LoRA
Axolotl for simplified training
LLaMA Factory

5. Deploy It
Use a lightweight inference framework:
text-generation-webui
vLLM (for fast inference)
Ollama (run locally)

Example: Fine-tuning an LLM for Cryptic Clue Solving
Collect data: Clues, solutions, and breakdowns
Format: Prompt/response pairs for training
Model: Fine-tune a 7B model using LoRA
Training: Run on a single A100 (or use Colab for tiny models)
Inference: Build a UI or API to let users enter clues

Summary
Option	Difficulty	Cost	Use Case
Full LLM from scratch	Extreme	$$$$	Academic, foundational research
Fine-tune open model	Moderate	$–$$	Domain-specific models (e.g., crosswords)
Prompt engineering/RAG	Easy	Free–$	Fast customization without retraining
